## RTSP-FindingSomeFun
- RTSP-FindingSomeFun is a tool that performs RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) brute-forcing and scanning on a list of IP addresses. The tool uses a wordlist of username and password combinations to attempt to authenticate to each IP address and determine if it is hosting an RTSP stream. The tool is able to scan a large number of IP addresses using multithreading, which increases the speed of the scan. This makes it easy to review the results of the scan and identify any RTSP streams that were discovered by using a combination of brute-forcing and scanning.
